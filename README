Clamav directory contains a pre-built binary of clamav program, when pushing to Blumix, you have two ways to go:

1. push the clamav directory along with the source code, in that case, the pushde clamav program will be used .

2. push without the clamav directory, at this stage, the build pack will attemp to build clamav on build time.
